<p>
    
<ol>
    <li> <b>Select</b> your options.<br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Answer the questions, and review your choices.<br />
You are anonymous at this point (login is at step 3, after encryption).</span></li>
<br />

    <li> <b>Encrypt</b> your selection.<br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">
  Your selection is encrypted safely inside in your browser.<br />

</li>
<br />

    <li> <b>Submit</b> your encrypted ballot.<br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Record your ballot tracking number.<br />
